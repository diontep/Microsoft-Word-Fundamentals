<h2>STEP 11: Display your footnotes</h2>

Word for the web does not display footnotes in Editing mode. There are [at least] 2 ways to display footnotes:

You can use Reading View in the Document Views group of the View tab

You can change from Editing mode to Viewing mode.

<h2>STEP 12: Create a header and footer</h2>

A header is a line that runs along the top of every page of your document. A footer is a line that runs along the bottom of every page of your document.

Using the Header & Footer group (of the Insert tab), click on Header & Footer.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5OXvbml.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />

The text in a header and/or a footer can be left-justified, centered, or right-justified.

In the header area, type the following (without the quotes) so that it becomes left-justified:
“Microcomputer Applications Area”

You will need to adjust the column width of the text area so that the text will fit on a single line.

In the footer area, type the following (without the brackets) so that it becomes left-justified:
[Your Name]

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oK1hk8L.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />

Click anywhere on the document outside the Header & Footer editor window to complete the action.

<h2>STEP 13: Add page numbers to the footer</h2>

Using the Header & Footer group (of the Insert tab), click on Page Numbers.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/M20jO68.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />

Add the page numbers to the right side of the footer.

You can also insert a page break by using the Pages group (of the Insert tab) and clicking on Page Break.

<h2>STEP 15: Display your header and footer (and footnotes)</h2>

Just like it is with footnotes, Word for the web does not display your header and footer in Editing mode.
